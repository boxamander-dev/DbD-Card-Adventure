	<h1>BoxAmander's Dead by Daylight Card Adventure!</h1>
	<h2>The hardcore killer challenge in Dead by Daylight has been around for quite some time.<br>
						I wanted to create my own spin on the idea, and thus the Card Adventure was born! <br>
						The idea is simple: Complete your goal (usually reaching Iridescent Grade Rank 1) with the <br>
						cards you acquire throughout the adventure! Which cards you play will determine your loadout.<br>
						Generate a new game with the button below.

	<h2>If you have already generated a game but closed the tab, click the above button</h2>
	<h1> How to Play</h1>
	<h2>* At the start of a new game, you will draw a set amount of Killer cards. These are your available killers for<br>
						the rest of the challenge. You will then draw a larger amount of Loadout cards. These determine what perks<br>
						and add-ons you are allowed to bring each match. Loadout cards come with a cost value, and you cannot exceed<br>
						a total cost; Depending on your Loadout cards, you may not be able to bring a full loadout into the match.<br>
						* Upon reaching a milestone, you draw additional Killer cards. Depending on your settings, the Loadout cards<br>
						are either redrawn completely, or you get to add more Loadout cards to your hand.<br>
						* Unless you only have a single Killer card remaining, you cannot use the same Killer card twice in a row;<br>
						Unless you have multiple copies of the same Loadout card, Loadout cards cannot be used twice in a row either.
						</h2>
	<h1> Losing Cards </h1>
	<h2>* Once an eligible match is completed, you will report various match results.<br>
						This will provide a score result value. If you do not meet a minimum set value, then you will<br>
						lose the Killer and Loadout cards you played that match. Lose all killer cards before goal completion, and it is game over.<br>
	<h1>Flexibility</h1>
	<h2>* While the rules of the card challenge are listed above, you are not forced to strictly follow them. When generating<br>
						a new game, there are a variety of adjustable options; there are recommended default values.<br>
						* Likewise, it is up to you to report when you reach a milestone. This means that you can use the<br>
						Card Adventure to complete a path to Iridescent 1, but you may come up with your own ideas, such as <br>
						completing 20 matches, with a milestone occurring after every five matches.
